SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '20170101' AND '20170131';

SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT MIN(wholesale_price) AS cheapest_product FROM products;
SELECT MAX(quantity) AS biggest_order FROM orders;

SELECT * FROM employees;

SELECT SUM(hours) FROM employees;

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM orders
